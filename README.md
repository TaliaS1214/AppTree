AppTree
================
This application requires:

- Ruby 2.1.2
- Rails 4.1.4

Getting Started
---------------
AppTree is a site that makes the process of finding the best iOS apps easier.
Just search by genre to see what the most popular apps are according to user
upvotes. Neither AppTree nor Apple determines which apps are the best - you do.


Documentation and Support
-------------------------
The back end of AppTree uses Rails, and the front end uses Javascript, jQuery,
and your good old friend Backbone. Input regarding how to improve AppTree
is always welcomed.
